# Beat the Algorithm

Beat the Algorithm is an interactive website that provides a platform for users to challenge themselves against various algorithms. The goal is to solve a given problem faster than the algorithm itself.

## How it Works

1\. **Choose an Algorithm**: Select an algorithm from the menu. This menu contains algorithms that solve problems related to sorting, searching, graph algorithms, and more.

2\. **Understand the Challenge**: Each algorithm comes with a clear description of what to do. Also, it provides information about the algorithm

3\. **Interact with Algorithms**: Learn about the inner workings of a specific algorithm designed to solve the chosen problem. Interact with the algorithm step by step to gain insights into its approach.

4\. **Beat the Algorithm**: Put your problem-solving skills to the test by attempting to solve the problem faster than the algorithm.

5\. **Learn and Improve**: Regardless of the outcome, gain valuable insights into the algorithm's efficiency and techniques for solving the problem. Compare your approach with the algorithm's solution to identify areas for improvement.

## Features

- **Multiple Algorithms**: A collection of algorithms covering various problem categories, ensuring a diverse challenge experience.

- **Difficulty Levels**: Each algorithm offers four difficulty levels: Easy, Intermediate, Hard, and Impossible. Choose the level that suits your expertise and challenge yourself accordingly.

- **Detailed Explanations**: Each algorithm is accompanied by detailed explanations, providing a comprehensive understanding of its functionality and optimization techniques.

- **Interactive Interface**: Interact with the algorithms through an intuitive interface, enabling you to understand their progress and logic.

- **Personalized Learning**: Choose specific algorithms and explore them at your own pace, fostering a personalized learning experience.
